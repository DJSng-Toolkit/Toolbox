A maximalist approach on [TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) with a bunch of tools, mods, websites and other utilities, all personally curated with better compatibility notes, and specific sub-version mod configs. **This is not a replacement for existing lists**, you should still turn to other lists to back up sources.

Toolkit is mainly based on personal experience. I 

## Why?
A lot of lists are very similiar nowadays, it can make sense why it can feel like just *another* list. There's many choices, with TheUsefulLists being a general "go-to" and a lot of TUL inspired lists covering their tracks.  
However, I also wanted to take a shot. I struggle a lot with my own notes, and I've had my fair share of modding oppertunities where I just completely forgot some mods are incompatible. Plus, I play with a lot of scenario specific mods and find out about incompatibilities from mod developers that I don't find out until last minute. So, I wanted to make a TheUsefulLists adjacent project with a bit more documentation.  
And then Toolkit was born.

# Disclaimer
Mods are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list, I cannot check every single update manually. You should check mods on your own time using provided file hashes, extracting the file contents, or whatever means you see fit.
