A bunch of mods for Minecraft. Inspired by TheUsefulLists (but not affiliated), with my own curated list of optimizations. Also has other non-mod resources like [UsefulMinecraft](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMinecraft).  
Remember to view the [main branch README](../README.md) for icon meaning.  
 
This section is mostly just based on mods I'm familiar with for performance in addition to some stuff also featured on TUL and some other mods I've also heard of. In addition to basic performance and bugfixes, my "enhancements" list includes a mix of Vanilla (like TUL) and Vanilla+ utilities. I am also considering a "Recommendations" section for some popular community suggestions.

## Disclaimer
Mods are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list, I cannot check every single update manually. You should check mods on your own time using provided file hashes, extracting the file contents, or whatever means you see fit.
