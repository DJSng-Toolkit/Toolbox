| [3D\-Skin\-Layers](https://modrinth.com/mod/3dskinlayers) | Unknown | Render the player skin layer in 3D! | tr7zw | Client | Works with CustomSkinLoader after installing [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinlayers3d-customskinloader-bridge). No Lunar Client support. Understandable, they stole your mod. |
| [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) | None | Food/hunger-related HUD improvements | squeek502 | Client | Also installable on the server for saturation and exhaustion values (not necessary on singleplayer). Paper version is available, see the mod page. [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) has an alternative in the form of a Resource Pack, but is basic and does not show saturation or exhaustion, only the food's hunger values. |
| [Armor Visibility](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-visibility) | None | Let that skin show! | Trikzon | Client | Toggle with "V" by default, rebindable. Mod config lets you also show elytra, and hide it on mobs (bad idea) too. |
| [Chat Heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/chat-heads) | Servers that use custom chat plugins [^1] | See who you're chatting with! | dzwdz | Client | Cracked servers work, but your skin may not update properly, especially if using SkinsRestorer. |
| [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) | None | A Minecraft mod that allows for efficient connected textures | PepperCode1 | Client | Reimplimentation of OptiFine's "Connected textures" feature. Works standalone (enable the built-in resource pack to connect glass) and with resource packs. Their Forge compatibility is poor, don't use it. |
| [Falling Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingleaves) | None | Adds a neat little particle effect to leaf blocks | Fourmisain | Client | Has an unofficial [Forge port](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge) on CurseForge. This feature might have been added in newer versions of MineCraft. |
| [Smooth Scrolling Refurbished](https://modrinth.com/mod/smooth-scrolling-refurbished) | Unknown | Changes most scrollbars in the game to scroll smoothly. | JustAlittleWolf | Client | N/A |
| [WaveyCapes](https://modrinth.com/mod/wavey-capes) | Unknown | The cape shouldn't be a static slab | tr7zw | Client | N/A |

| [My Resource Pack, My Choice](https://modrinth.com/mod/my-resource-pack) | Unknown | Allows you to skip, block and disable certain server resources and to move or ignore and remove it completely | MrKinau | Client | Maybe be very careful using this. |
| [Quick Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/quick-menu) | Unknown | A client-side mod that adds a configurable easy-to-access menu that runs basic repetitive commands. | ImCodist | Client | Also works on 1.21.5 if you use [this PR's artifact build.](https://github.com/ImCodist/quick-menu/actions/runs/15097735005?pr=30). |
| [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus) | C2ME | Minecraft Fabric mod which allows you to join EVERY Minecraft server version  | FlorianMichael | Client | C2ME causes issues in some cases when installed. Additionally, the last 1-2 Minecraft versions are the only currently supported versions, so make sure to update before you send a bug report. Very cursed, but very helpful. |

If you are using Prism, you may need to enable "Skip java compatibility checks". Do not do this unless you are sure you need to. |
