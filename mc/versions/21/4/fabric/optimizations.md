[^1]: Original repo only goes up to 1.21.1 but you can get 1.21.2+ if you use [drouarb's fork](https://github.com/drouarb/nvidium).

[^2]: Using Iris and Distant Horizions at once seems to cause issues with RenderScale. See [this thread](https://github.com/Zolo101/RenderScale/issues/26) for potential fixes.
