| Name | Incompatibilities | Description | Author | Client / Server | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [3D\-Skin\-Layers](https://modrinth.com/mod/3dskinlayers) | Unknown | Render the player skin layer in 3D! | tr7zw | Client | Works with CustomSkinLoader after installing [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinlayers3d-customskinloader-bridge). No Lunar Client support. Understandable, they stole your mod. |
| [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) | None | Food/hunger-related HUD improvements | squeek502 | Client | Also installable on the server for saturation and exhaustion values (not necessary on singleplayer). Paper version is available, see the mod page. [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) has an alternative in the form of a Resource Pack, but is basic and does not show saturation or exhaustion, only the food's hunger values. |
| [Boosted Brightness](https://modrinth.com/mod/boosted-brightness) | Unknown | Set your brightness beyond default levels. | adamviola | Client | May have incompatibility issues with some video option mods. |
| [Chat Heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/chat-heads) | Servers that use custom chat plugins [^1] | See who you're chatting with! | dzwdz | Client | Cracked servers work, but your skin may not update properly, especially if using SkinsRestorer. |
| [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) | Unknown | Adds dynamic lights to Minecraft as the most feature-complete and optimized dynamic lighting mod for Fabric. | LambdAurora | Client | Implementation of OptiFine's "Dynamic Lights" feature. If you use shaders, use your shader pack's dedicated option instead. |

| [Client Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/client-tweaks) | Unknown |  Various optional tweaks to improve Minecraft Quality of Life.  | BlayTheNinth | Client | A bunch of random building related tweaks. Users with media key keyboards might experience issues with their volume slider hiding their offhand item. |
| [Not So Essential](https://modrinth.com/mod/notsoessential) |  Unknown | Keeps only what's Essential  | Scherso | Client | Good for killing telmetry and a lot of features in Essential for those who use it as a dependancy, but you should really still avoid Essential entirely. |
| [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) |  Unknown | Displays a map of the nearby world terrain, players, mobs, entities in the corner of your screen. | Xaero | Client | If you plan to use on servers and you have OP/Teleport permissions, open Default Teleport Command and change it to `tp x y z`. Also has waypoints. Please change the default controls. |
| [Zoomify](https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomify) | Unknown | A zoom mod with infinite customizability. | isxander | Client | Reimplementation of OptiFine's Zoom feature. You may also prefer [OK Zoomer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ok-zoomer) instead. |

If you are using Prism, you may need to enable "Skip java compatibility checks". Do not do this unless you are sure you need to. |
