| [3D\-Skin\-Layers](https://modrinth.com/mod/zV5r3pPn) | Unknown | Render the player skin layer in 3D! | tr7zw | Client | Works with CustomSkinLoader after installing [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinlayers3d-customskinloader-bridge). No Lunar Client support. Understandable, they stole your mod. |
| [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/EsAfCjCV) | None | Food/hunger-related HUD improvements | squeek502 | Client | Also installable on the server for saturation and exhaustion values (not necessary on singleplayer). Paper version is available, see the mod page. [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) has an alternative in the form of a Resource Pack, but is basic and does not show saturation or exhaustion, only the food's hunger values. |
| [Chat Heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/Wb5oqrBJ) | Servers that use custom chat plugins [^1] | See who you're chatting with! | dzwdz | Client | Cracked servers work, but your skin may not update properly, especially if using SkinsRestorer. |
| [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) | None | A Minecraft mod that allows for efficient connected textures | PepperCode1 | Client | Reimplimentation of OptiFine's "Connected textures" feature. Works standalone (enable the built-in resource pack to connect glass) and with resource packs. Their Forge compatibility is poor, don't use it. |

| [Presence Footsteps](https://modrinth.com/mod/presence-footsteps) | Unknown | ..An Overly complicated Sound Mod... | Sollace | Client | Some versions may require you to use a non-normal version of the Java JDK (i.e: JDK 17 when JDK 16 is the only supported version for some launchers). If you are using Prism, you may need to enable "Skip java compatibility checks". Do not do this unless you are sure you need to. |
