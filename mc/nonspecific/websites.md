| [⭐ VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) | Vanilla Tweaks is about tweaking parts of the vanilla game that we believe can be a little bit better. | VanillaTweaks Team | Resource Pack generator that has a bunch of texture tweaks. Really cool! |
| [Aikar's Flags](https://aikar.co/2018/07/02/tuning-the-jvm-g1gc-garbage-collector-flags-for-minecraft/) | Tuning the JVM – G1GC Garbage Collector Flags for Minecraft | Aikar | Might benefit some users. Be careful. |
| [List of "Essential" 1.7.10 Mods](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c) | This is a list of Minecraft 1.7.10 mods that are not focused on adding new original content. Instead, they make the base game run better, or port over features from other versions of vanilla. | Makamys | Good list that goes more in depth about 1.7 options, for retro modders. |
| [PCGamingWiki's page on Minecraft](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Minecraft:_Java_Edition) | From PCGamingWiki, the wiki about fixing PC games  | General information. Not as effective as mod lists, so maybe don't lean on it's advice too hard. |
| [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) | Just a list of useful mods  | TheUsefulLists | The original inspiration for this list! They focus on actually clumping together mods rather than being selective about mods like I'm aiming for, so they might also have a few extra mods I miss. |
