| [Legacy Fabric Mod Compatibility List](legacyfabric.net/mods.html) | General list for mod compatibility for Legacy Fabric supported versions. | Legacy Fabric | N/A |
| [List of "Essential" 1.7.10 Mods](https://gist.github.com/makamys/7cb74cd71d93a4332d2891db2624e17c) | This is a list of Minecraft 1.7.10 mods that are not focused on adding new original content. Instead, they make the base game run better, or port over features from other versions of vanilla. | Makamys | Good list that goes more in depth about 1.7 options, for retro modders. |
| [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) | Just a list of useful mods  | TheUsefulLists | The original inspiration for this list! They focus on actually clumping together mods rather than being selective about mods like I'm aiming for, so they might also have a few extra mods I miss. |
