# Config specific cases
### (e.g. Safe in most cases)
| Name | Incompatibilities | Version | Client / Server | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Reese's Sodium Options](https://modrinth.com/mod/reeses-sodium-options) | Non-sodium rendering engines | 1.16.5+ | Client | **For 90% of configs, it's safe to install this mod**, but it should be noticed that I've experienced crashes on a couple of configs, most noticably 1.20.1 on Fabric. Be careful! |


# Actually avoid these
| Name | Incompatibilities | Version | Client / Server | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [OptiFine](https://optifine.net) | Several mods | b1.7.3+ (except 1.21.5) | Client | Poor mod compatibility, weak optimizations, closed source, among many other reasons. **Only recommended for non-1.7 and non-1.15+ uses.** |
| [Fastload](https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload) | Unknown | 1.18.x - 1.20.1 | Both | It's safer than Kyxsis at the cost of being unstable. I've had poor experiences with this mod. Also, since 25w31a, you no longer need this mod because of changes to chunk loading. |
| [FPS to the Trash](https://modrinth.com/mod/fps-to-the-trash) | VulkanMod | 1.15+ | Client | Doesn't actually optimize the game, just tosses frames the monitor can't see. |
