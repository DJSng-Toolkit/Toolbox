A project about Lists‚Ñ¢ and resources, inspired by [TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods).

Toolkit is a project by DJSng inspired by [Alkyaly's Performance Mods list for Minecraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201121958/https://gist.github.com/alkyaly/02830c560d15256855bc529e1e232e88) and it's continuation TUL, containing personal notes and modding resources mainly based on my own experiences. It is mainly tailored to beginners, but is also meant to be used for general resources for all. Toolkit is stacked with notes based on situations that have happened to me before, in hopes of documenting situations that other users might also be in, as well as being a more curated version of many lists out there.

By default, everything's organized in categories and also comes with emoji labels for mods that have earned their status for being miracle medicine. I've also included some new, early, experimental and what I think is some more obscure stuff that users might also benefit from. The project is mainly based my previous attempts to make a modpack that optimizes Minecraft that I attempted to publish to Curseforge called "Adventurer's Toolkit", which later became the basis for the private no-site modpack DJSng's Toolkit, where the name of the project comes from.

## Disclaimer
<!-- TUL did this, maybe it's best i do this too. Idk if Kevsky is cool with me pretty much copying his homework though -->
While I test mods on my own time to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, especially since I depend on a lot of these mods myself, you should still check mods yourself with provided file hashes, content extraction tools (like 7-ZIP), and other methods that you see fit. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list.

I try my best to keep up to date in the modding communities that may be affected by malware attacks and similar attacks, such as Minecraft, but I cannot stay up to date *as soon as it happens* because I have a life outside of this guide. Exercise caution and keep up to date with trusted resources and communities.

> [!NOTE]
> You still need to read mod descriptions and notes for any incompatibilities.

| Fix category | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Essential | Makes an impact in most situations, you should definitely have this installed. |
| Situational | Might have an impact to some, some users may be unaffected. You should still install this if you can. |
| Edge case | Non-essential but may make an impact to specific users. Okay if you need the most out of a low spec device. |
| Deprecated | This mod is no longer required since a certain game version. |
| Succeeded | A new mod does what this mod does, see notes. May still be needed for specific game versions. |
| Possible snake oil | Obscure, new or not tested, may make performance worse. Try at your own discretion. |
| Snake oil | Doesn't actually optimize the game in a meaningful way. It might make performance worse, the performance might not change at all. |
