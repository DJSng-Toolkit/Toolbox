Soon.  
A project inspired by [Alkyaly's Performance Mods list for Minecraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201121958/https://gist.github.com/alkyaly/02830c560d15256855bc529e1e232e88) and NordicGamerFE / TheUsefulList's [official continunation](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods)

## Disclaimer
Mods are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list, I cannot check every single update manually. You should check mods on your own time using provided file hashes, extracting the file contents, or whatever means you see fit.  

This is a a fan project inspired by TheUsefulLists, which does not endorse Placeholder.
