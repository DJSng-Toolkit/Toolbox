# Toolkit: Tools for the Modder's Toolbox
### A gaming resource created by DJSng about Lists‚Ñ¢ and documentation

> [!NOTE]  
> Toolkit is in early development by a one man team. It may lack information or need corrections.


Inspired by [Alkyaly's Performance Mods list for Minecraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201121958/https://gist.github.com/alkyaly/02830c560d15256855bc529e1e232e88) and it's official continuation [TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) (but not affiliated or endorsed by either), Toolkit is a collection of modding resources for a couple of funny video games. While TUL has it's own objectives and purpose, Toolkit is intended to be a personal take on Minecraft mod lists, meant to provide more obscure resources and more personalized documentation. It is based on my own instances to ensure the information is practical, and I have included notes where possible.  
Please keep in mind that I am a one person team, so all information may be outdated or lacking at times. I'm trying my hardest to stay up to date.

The name "Toolkit" comes from the private modpack "DJSng's Toolkit" by the same author.

## Disclaimer
<!-- TUL did this, maybe it's best i do this too. Idk if Kevsky is cool with me pretty much copying his homework though -->
While I test mods on my own time to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, especially since I depend on a lot of these mods myself, you should still check mods yourself with provided file hashes, content extraction tools (like 7-ZIP), and other methods that you see fit. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list.

I try my best to keep up to date in the modding communities that may be affected by malware attacks and similar attacks, such as Minecraft, but I cannot stay up to date *as soon as it happens* because I have a life outside of this guide. Exercise caution and keep up to date with trusted resources and communities.

| Fix category | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Essential | Makes an impact in most situations, you should definitely have this installed. |
| Situational | Might have an impact to some, some users may be unaffected. You should still install this if you can. |
| Edge case | Non-essential but may make an impact to specific users. Okay if you need the most out of a low spec device. |
| Deprecated | This mod is no longer required since a certain game version. |
| Succeeded | A new mod does what this mod does, see notes. May still be needed for specific game versions. |
| Possible snake oil | Obscure, new or not tested, may make performance worse. Try at your own discretion. |
| Snake oil | Doesn't actually optimize the game in a meaningful way. It might make performance worse, the performance might not change at all. |
