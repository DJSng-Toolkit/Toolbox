Toolkit, a fan project created by DJSng inspired by [Alkyaly's Performance Mods list for Minecraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201121958/https://gist.github.com/alkyaly/02830c560d15256855bc529e1e232e88) and it's continuation [TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods), about being a multilist and miniwiki for a couple of funny video games.  
It is mainly tailored to beginners, and it's information is mainly tailored to users who may be having issues that are both bizzare and normal.

Toolkit is mainly meant for users who want or need resources and recommendations for alternative tools for their game, as well as notes based on my own personal experience. It's mainly meant for Minecraft, but also has a few other lists that might be of help. Along with a collection of mods that might be new to a user, toolkit also offers utilities for outside the game that might also be of interest. Although it's very similar to lists, Toolkit also contains a mini wiki for games that might also be of help for edge cases.

The project is mainly based my previous attempts to make a modpack that optimizes Minecraft that I attempted to publish to Curseforge called "Adventurer's Toolkit", which later became the basis for the private no-site modpack DJSng's Toolkit, where the name of the project comes from.

Toolkit is similar TheUsefulList's UsefulMinecraft list of Performance mods, though not directly based on it with more new, early and experimental optimizations as well as more Incompatibility and general notes,   server friendly mods users can install on their client to aid them in various ways, and some other non-fix mods mainly meant for players who want Vanilla+ resources as well.

## Disclaimer
<!-- TUL did this, maybe it's best i do this too. Idk if Kevsky is cool with me pretty much copying his homework though -->
While I test mods on my own time to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, especially since I depend on a lot of these mods myself, you should still check mods yourself with provided file hashes, content extraction tools (like 7-ZIP), and other methods that you see fit. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list.

I try my best to keep up to date in the modding communities that may be affected by malware attacks and similar attacks, such as Minecraft, but I cannot stay up to date *as soon as it happens* because I have a life outside of this guide. Exercise caution and keep up to date with trusted resources and communities.

| Fix category | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Essential | Makes an impact in most situations, you should definitely have this installed. |
| Situational | Might have an impact to some, some users may be unaffected. You should still install this if you can. |
| Edge case | Non-essential but may make an impact to specific users. Okay if you need the most out of a low spec device. |
| Deprecated | This mod is no longer required since a certain game version. |
| Succeeded | A new mod does what this mod does, see notes. May still be needed for specific game versions. |
| Possible snake oil | Obscure, new or not tested, may make performance worse. Try at your own discretion. |
| Snake oil | Doesn't actually optimize the game in a meaningful way. It might make performance worse, the performance might not change at all. |
