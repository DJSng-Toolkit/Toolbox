# Placeholder
A documentation and performance optimization guide / list inspired by [Alkyaly's Performance Mods list for Minecraft](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201121958/https://gist.github.com/alkyaly/02830c560d15256855bc529e1e232e88) (and NordicGamerFE / TheUsefulList's [official continunation](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods)).

Placeholder is based my two previous attempts to make a modpack that optimizes Minecraft that I attempted to publish to Curseforge (and later privately shared to friends as DJSng's Toolkit) called "Adventurer's Toolkit", and expands upon TUL's execution by adding guides for more games and documenting more edge cases for possible incompatibilities.   
This list is a fan project that tries to expand upon TUL's execution by including more than performance and adding more in depth notes to some mods that might have edge cases.

This is a fan project inspired by TheUsefulLists, which does not endorse Placeholder in any way.

## Disclaimer
Mods are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list, I cannot check every single update manually. You should check mods on your own time using provided file hashes, extracting the file contents, or whatever means you see fit.
