# Toolkit: ROBLOX
> [!WARNING]
> 90% of flags are snake oil and may not make a difference. Worst case scenario, it might actually make your performance **worse**.  
> If you ever have issues with your game that causes UI bugs or otherwise has disabled features that used to work, the first thing you should do is disable all of your custom flags and use your launcher's built-in option to not apply modifications on next launch.  
> Remember to also tell your launcher to completely reinstall ROBLOX.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ROBLOX plans to remove FastFlags soon due to user abuse. These flags may stop working at any time.  
> Toolkit is not a FastFlag guide.

A bunch of fan utilities for ROBLOX.  
Remember to view the [main branch README](../README.md) for icon meaning.  

## Disclaimer
Mods are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list, I cannot check every single update manually. You should check mods on your own time using provided file hashes, extracting the file contents, or whatever means you see fit.
