# Toolkit: WEBFISHING
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All mods here require **GDWeave**. You should also install **Tacklebox**, as it adds a Mods button to edit settings, making some mods require it

A bunch of mods for WEBFISHING. Mostly just Quality of Life.

## Disclaimer
Mods are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list, I cannot check every single update manually. You should check mods on your own time using provided file hashes, extracting the file contents, or whatever means you see fit.  

## Mod Types
<!-- NOTE yes this works. >
Remember to view the [main branch README](../README.md) for icon meaning.
